# Planner

This project is a simple planner, used with this [simulator](https://github.com/LoicGoulefert/Simulateur-robot-lego).
It currently uses the Dijkstra algorithm to search for the best solution in a state graph.
The final objective is to implement the A* algorithm to search the state graph, using graphplan as a heuristic.

## How to install the dependencies

```
pip3 install antlr-python2-runtime
pip3 install antlr-python3-runtime
pip3 install pddlpy
```
